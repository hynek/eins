There is only a Makefile, feel free to adjust it as it suits to you.

`eins' uses extensively some features of the C99 standard, so make
sure your compiler can handle them (gcc 3.0 or newer should be fine).

Modules, which have non-standard dependencies, have to be explicitely
activated. So far, this only applies to BMI. Build it with `make
WITH_BMI=1` (don't forget a `make clean' if you have objects from
previous builds).


The following variables additionally affect the build process:

    DEBUG:  Build a debugable executable.
    STATIC: Build a static executable using the diet libc. Hold
    	    in mind, that it might get hairy with external
	    dependencies (eg. PVFS2).

They can be all set on the make commandline or set as env variables.


Example: Build a debugable BMI-enabled executable:

	 make WITH_BMI=1 DEBUG=1
or
	 WITH_BMI=1 DEBUG=1 make
or
	 export WITH_BMI=1
	 export DEBUG=1
	 make
