	* mod_bmi.c (bmi_init): BMI_initialize() get run only the first
	time now.
	(bmi_cleanup): BMI_finalize() doesn't get called at all
	anymore. The reason for these changes is that BMI starts to behave
	strange when BMI_initialize()/BMI_finalize() get run too
	often (~1021).

	* eins.c (main): Enhaced progress indicator (added absolute value
	in bytes)

	* mod_bmi.c (bmi_init): Added code to handle immediate completion.

	* eins.c (main): Added support for iterating through several
	values.
	(main): Added simple progress indicator.
	(parse_args): Adjusted to new arguments.

	* eins.h (prefs): Added general prefs struct. Removed `no_time'
	from mod_args.

	* eins.c (GENERAL_USAGE): Clarified and enhaced usage.

	* ChangeLog: File added.
