Hynek Schlawack <hs+eins@ox.cx> wrote `eins' by heavily generalizing
`sockping'. He wrote the modules for TCP, UDP and BMI. He is also the
current maintainer.

I can't remember implementing the SCTP backend so I figure someone else was
involved too. My best guess is JÃ¶rg Zinke.

Lars Schneidenbach <lschneid@cs.uni-potsdam.de> wrote the original
`sockping' which still dominates `eins'' operating principle. He is also
the author of the original measure code.

Giuseppe Ciaccio <ciaccio@disi.unige.it> wrote the original code taken
for measurements, i.e. get_time, time_diff and mean_variance
